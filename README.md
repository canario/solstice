## Assumptions

* The name and email are the only mandatory fields.

* The Address and the phone aren't mandatory fields.

* If the address is sent, all the fields are mandatory, except the latitude and longitude.

* An in-memory database is used for this project. If necessary it could change it easily for a disk storage database only changing the properties in the application.yml and add the dependency in the build.gradle


## Deploying in Amazon Web Services (AWS)

To deploy in AWS you only need to add the jar generated by this command:

* ./gradlew clean build

You need to add the application.yml and the messages.properties in the same folder.
